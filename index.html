   <h1>about me</h1>
   <p>I Shafi Ehsan aim to achieve the degree of a mobile developer in hopes of starting my own phone business in Canada somewhere in Ontario preferably near my family. I hope to achieve this degree by the end of this year and start doing some work to gain some experience in the field and hopefully in 2-3 years I start my own business in the field. Why did I choose this field and why do I think this best fits me and my personality? It is because I’ve always been into phones, apps and anything that makes what has made our live’s better, easier and more productive and has helped our daily life work easier. I was always fascinated by how these things worked and how we humans are always developing and evolving. Being able to repair these things such a mobile device or developing my own mobile device or creating my own app to help people make better decisions and make better choices or even to make their live’s easier. I work as a truck driver at the moment and creating an app that can precisely tell you truck stops rest area be able to book parking spaces within the app or an address you cannot find on the trucking gps the app can help with that. Gives warnings on bridges, highways, traffic’s, etc. In conclusion, I hope to learn as much as I can from this course to succeed in the field and to better understand how I can use the skills and knowledge to achieve these goals like opening up my own device repair shop,developing my own app and or device.
